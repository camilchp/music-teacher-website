# music-teacher-website

ðŸŽµ A simple website to practice music theory, available at [h.champin.net/music-teacher](h.champin.net/music-teacher) ðŸŽµ

## Exercises include:

1. interval training
2. triad recognition
3. chord progression recognition

> The "Sight Reading" section is currently empty...

> Iphones are currently not supported because of default sound confinguration (all other devices should work fine)

Most of the site is coded in python (music.py does most of the musical calculations, script.py scripts the interface), which is allowed by the brython javascript files (at the time of making this website, my JS knowledge is abysmall). However, a lot is being done by leveraging CSS classes !
I'm currently trying to learn Web APIs to leverage Spotify's kit, as well as iReal's song database to provide chord-progression guessing with ACTUAL music ! Stay tuned ! (EADGBE) ;)
